## üêç Python Installation Required

The face recognition service requires Python 3.8+ to be installed on your system.

### Windows Installation:

1. **Download Python:**
   - Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Download Python 3.8 or higher for Windows
   - Run the installer

   - Click "Install Now"

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```cmd
   python --version
   pip --version
   ```

4. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   ```cmd
   cd python_service
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Start Python Service:**
   ```cmd
   python face_recognition_service.py
   ```

### Alternative: Use Python Launcher

If `python` command doesn't work, try:
```cmd
py --version
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
py face_recognition_service.py
```

   - Add new employees
   - View scan statistics
   - Monitor system status

2. **User Interface** (http://localhost:3000):
   - Switch to "User Access" mode
   - Camera interface ready
   - Face scanning UI (will work once Python service is running)

3. **Desktop App**:
   - Full Electron app with all features
   - Same functionality as web version
   - Native desktop experience

## üîß **Next Steps:**

1. **Install Python** (see instructions above)

   cd python_service
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Start Python service:**
   ```cmd
   python face_recognition_service.py
   ```
4. **Test face recognition** in the user interface

## üì± **DroidCam Setup (Optional):**

Once Python is running, you can also set up DroidCam:
1. Install DroidCam on your phone
2. Connect to same WiFi network
3. Update `DROIDCAM_IP` in `server/.env` with your phone's IP
4. The system will use DroidCam as camera source

## üéâ **System is 80% Ready!**

Your face recognition system is almost complete. Just install Python and you'll have full face recognition capabilities!
