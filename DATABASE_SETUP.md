- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

#### **Scan History Table**
- `id` - Primary key (auto-increment)
- `employee_id` - Foreign key to employees table
- `scan_type` - ENUM: 'success', 'failed', 'unknown'
- `confidence` - Recognition confidence score (0-1)

### 📈 Performance Optimizations

The following indexes have been created for optimal performance:

**Employees Table:**
- Unique index on `employee_id`
- Index on `is_active` for filtering active employees
- Index on `created_at` for sorting

**Scan History Table:**
- Index on `employee_id` for joins
- Index on `scan_type` for filtering scan results
- Index on `scanned_at` for time-based queries
- Index on `ip_address` for security monitoring
